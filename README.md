# README

Python is a general-purpose programming language [that is very popular](https://madnight.github.io/githut/). In bioinformatics, Python has replaced Perl as the scripting language of choice, which means there's a lot more Python scripts in my area of work. I'd like to learn Python to help me better understand a lot of bioinformatic scripts/tools.

# The Jupyter Notebook

The notebook formerly known as the [IPython Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) has also been on my list of things to learn. It serves as an interactive session for interweaving code and plain text. After [installation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), run `jupyter notebook` to host an interactive session. I will use Jupyter notebooks to keep track of my Python code.

# README

Python is a general-purpose programming language [that is very popular](https://madnight.github.io/githut/). I have wanted to learn Python for a long time but have put it off because I could get everything done using Bash, Perl, and R. However, recently I have been learning about deep learning and while I can use R and Keras, it is easier to use Python. I will keep my notes as Jupyter notebooks stored in `notebook`.

# The Jupyter Notebook

The notebook formerly known as the [IPython Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) has also been on my list of things to learn. It serves as an interactive session for interweaving code and plain text. Just install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for your operating system and that will install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

    wget -c https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    source ~/.bashrc

After installation, run `jupyter notebook` to host an interactive session. See the [Comprehensive Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Jupyter Notebooks for Data Science & Machine Learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/starters-guide-jupyter-notebook/) for a nice introduction to Jupyter notebooks.

## Jupyter Notebook using Docker

[Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) are a set of ready-to-run Docker images containing Jupyter applications and interactive computing tools. Use [jupyter/tensorflow-notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-tensorflow-notebook), which includes popular packages from the scientific Python ecosystem and the `tensorflow` and `keras` machine learning libraries.

    docker pull jupyter/tensorflow-notebook:latest

The script `docker_run.sh` (shown below) will start a Docker container called `tensorflow-notebook` that mounts the current directory on the host machine to `/data/` in the Docker container and listens on port 10000. Run `docker exec tensorflow-notebook jupyter notebook list` after starting the container to obtain the token needed to log into the notebook server.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

version=latest
image=jupyter/tensorflow-notebook:${version}
container_name=tensorflow-notebook
port=10000

# If you change the notebook username using the following:
#
#     -e NB_USER="my-username" \
#
# You will not be able to list currently running servers to obtain a token.
# Therefore just use the username jovyan
#
# In addition, you need to run as root (`--user root`)
# or else you will not be able to edit mounted files

docker run -d \
   --rm \
   -p ${port}:8888 \
   --name ${container_name} \
   --user root \
   -e NB_UID=$(id -u) \
   -e NB_GID=$(id -g) \
   -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work \
   ${image}

>&2 echo ${container_name} listening on port ${port}
>&2 echo -e "Run the following to get the token:\ndocker exec ${container_name} jupyter notebook list"

>&2 echo Done
exit 0
```

See [Common Features](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/common.html) for configurating the Jupyter Server with Docker.

## Jupyter Notebook shortcuts

In your Jupyter notebook, click on `Help` and then select `Keyboard Shortcuts` to see a comprehensive list of shortcuts.

Below are some shortcuts that I have found useful:

* The notebook has a command and edit mode; press `escape` to enter command mode and press `enter` to enter edit mode.
* In command mode, press `m` to change a cell to Markdown and `y` to change a cell to code
* Control+enter to execute code
* `a` and `b` to insert a cell above and below, respectively
* Vim shortcuts like `dd` and `hjkl` work in command mode
* If you want to split a cell, enter edit mode in the cell and move the cursor to where you want the split, then press control+shift+- (hyphen)
* To merge a cell, select the cells in command mode (shift+ up/down arrows), and then press shift+m

# Reticulate

The [reticulate package](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability.

    install.packages("reticulate")
    library(reticulate)
    use_python("/anaconda3/bin/python")

Check configurations

    # check if Python is available
    py_available()
    
    # check Python config
    py_config()
    
    # check if module is available
    py_module_available("umap")
    
    # check version of Python to use with reticulate
    # and location of module
    py_discover_config("umap")

Using Python in R Markdown

    ```{python}
    import sys
    print(sys.version)
    ```

    "## Object Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects need to participate in an inheritance hierarchy for code to qualify as being truly _object-oriented_ (OO). Python `class`'s are a coding structure and device used to implement objects in Python that support inheritance and are Python's main object-oriented programming (OOP) tool. Classes are Python program units, just like functions and modules: they are another way for packaging logic and data. Classes are like modules but they have three critical distinctions that make them more useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple instances - classes are used to generating one or more objects. Every time we call a class, we generate a new object with a distinct namespace. Each object generated from a class has access to the class's attributes and gets a namespace of its own for data that varies per object.\n",
    "2. Customisation via inheritance - classes can be extended by re-defining its attributes outside the class itself in new components coded as subclasses. More generally, classes can build up namespace hierarchies, which define names to be used by objects created from classes in the hierarchy.\n",
    "3. Operator overloading - classes can define objects that respond to operators by providing special protocol methods. For example, objects made with classes can be sliced, concatenated, indexed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP in Python is mainly achieved by two mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A special first argument in functions to receive the subject of a call\n",
    "2. An inheritance attribute search to support programming by customisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of OOP in Python comes down to the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    ">object.attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "When the object is derived from a `class` statement, the expression triggers a _search_ in Python that looks in a tree of linked objects that tries to find the first appearance of _attribute_; attribute fetches are tree searches. Inheritance is when objects lower in the tree inherits attributes attached to objects higher in the tree. Classes higher in the tree are called _superclasses_ (also called _base classes_) whereas classes lower in the tree are called _subclasses_ (also called _derived classes_). Superclasses provide behaviour shared by all their subclasses but because the search proceeds bottom up, subclasses may override behaviour defined in their superclasses by redefining superclass names lower in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By and large, OOP is about looking up attributes in trees with a special first argument (see below) in functions.**"

    "### Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and instances are two distinct object types in Python. Classes are used to generate instances and their attributes provide behaviour (data and functions) that is inherited by all instances generated by the class. Instances are items with attributes that record data specific to that particular instance. For example, we can create an `Employee` class that defines what it means to be an employee and from that class we generate `Employee` instances. Classes usually have functions attached to them (e.g. `compute_salary`) and the instances will have more basic data items used by the class's functions (e.g. hours_worked); instances are like records with data and classes are the programs for processing the records."

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a function that is attached to a class. If the expression `object.attribute` refers to a function (inside a class), the instance is passed as the first argument to the function, which is called `self` by convention. Methods go through this argument to process the subject of the call. Methods can be called either through an instance, e.g. `instance.method()`, or through a class, e.g. `class.method(instance)`."

    "### Coding classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Class statements generate a new class object and each time a class is called, a new instance object is generated. Classes are automatically linked to their superclasses and instances are automatically linked to the classes from which they were created from. When _multiple inheritance_, meaning that a class has more than one superclass, is used the left-to-right order used in the `class` statement determines the tree search order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes attached to instances are specific to the instance whereas attributes attached to classes are shared by all their subclasses and instances. Attributes are usually attached to classes by assignments made at the top level in `class` statements and not nested inside functions. Attributes are usually attached to instances by assignments to the special argument (`self`) passed to functions coded inside classes (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python automatically calls a method named `__init__` each time an instance is generated from a class and this method is known as the _constructor_. The `__init__` method is used to initialise instances when they are made and is part of a larger class of methods called _operator overloading methods_. Such methods are inherited in class trees and have double underscores at the start and end of their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method in an instance or subclass can be overridden by defining a function with the same name. This achieves the idea of _polymorphism_, which refers to the idea that an operation depends on the object being operated on. If an instance or subclass has a different method, then despite using the same code, the outcome will be different. Polymorphism can also be used to hide, i.e. encapsulate, interface differences because the code is consistent."

    "### Code reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes support code reuse in ways that other Python components cannot and this is the main purpose of OOP. With classes, we code by customising existing code, instead of either changing existing code in place or starting from scratch. Once you get used to programming by software customisation, writing a new program becomes a task of mising together existing superclasses that already implement the behaviour required by your program. In many application domains, collections of superclasses are known as _frameworks_ that implement common programming tasks as classes that are ready to be used in your programs. With frameworks, you often simply code a subclass that is specific to your purposes, and inherit from all class tree."
